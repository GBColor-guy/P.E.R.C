# P.E.R.C
This is just a gun code for people to see
with in the rocketlauncher script youll see that it handles the bullet spawn and the damage
but in the rocket script youll see that it handles the bullet speed and velocity
and my plan is to make it so the bullet has an @export: packedscene and make an explosion and then give the explosion its own damage
but my main problem is that i do not know how to handle making this all work so any help would be apriciated.
